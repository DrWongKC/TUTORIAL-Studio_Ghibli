INTRODUCTION:
A big part of working with JavaScript is knowing how to connect to APIs. As a fledgling developer, you may have been told at some point to just "play around with some APIs!" to learn what they are and how to work with them. If you've ever taken a look at the documentation for an API and had no idea where to start or what to do and gotten frustrated, this is the article for you.

We're going to make a very simple web app with plain JavaScript that will retrieve information from an API and display it on the page. There will be no server, dependencies, build tools, or anything else to further muddy the waters on an already difficult and confusing topic for beginners.
